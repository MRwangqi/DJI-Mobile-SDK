**Introduction**
**引言**

Smart batteries provide the energy required to run the products. Together with the flight controller, the smart battery can estimate remaining flight time and provide warnings when low battery thresholds are crossed. Batteries are easily swapped between flights, extending product use considerably.
智能电池提供运行无人机所需的能量。智能电池与飞控一起,可以估计剩余飞行时间,并在低于低电池报警值时提供警告。可插拔电池方便更换,扩展无人机的使用。

**Battery Parameters**
**电池参数**

Two important battery parameters are the amount of energy it can store when fully charged, and the amount of energy it currently has remaining. The remaining energy changes as energy is drawn from the battery during product operation and can be considered an instantaneous parameter. The amount of energy it can store when fully charged can be considered a lifetime parameter and due to battery chemistry reduces over time as the battery is cycled (discharged then charged).
额定容量,实际容量是两个重要的参数。瞬时容量随着电池的使用时间而减少,也称为实际容量。由于电池的化学性质随着电池循环(卸载然后充电)而逐渐减少，所以电池容量也可以称为电池寿命。
额定容量,实际容量是两个重要的参数。瞬时容量随着电池的使用时间而减少,也称为实际容量。完全充满电后的容量是额定容量，并且随着电池循环（放电然后充电），和随着时间的推移电池化学性质会降低。

Therefore as the battery ages, it will store less energy and hence total expected product use time (e.g. flight time) is reduced. Battery lifetime is typically defined as the number of cycles it can experience before its full charge energy is 80% of its full charge energy when new.
因此，随着电池老化，它将储存更少的能量，因此飞行时间就会减少。电池寿命通常定义为电池容量为新充满电能量的80％之前其可以经历的循环次数。

**Instantaneous Parameters**
**瞬时参数**

Instantaneous battery parameters such as remaining energy, voltage and current can be used to predict remaining flight time or product use. Remaining energy is described in milliamp hours. A battery with 1000 mAh remaining will be able to provide 1000 mA for one hour before running out of energy. Examining the instantaneous current being drawn from the battery can be a predictor for how long a battery will last.
瞬时电池参数（如剩余能量，电压和电流）可用于预测剩余飞行时间或产品使用情况。剩余电量以毫安小时表示。剩余电量为1000 mAh的电池在耗尽电量之前可以提供1000mA电流，持续一个小时。检查从电池输出的瞬时电流可以预测剩余电量使用时间。

**Lifetime Parameters**
**寿命参数**

Lifetime parameters such as total number of cycles (or discharges), full charge energy and remaining life time can be used to determine when a battery should be replaced. Applications often require a minimum amount of flight time to be economically efficient, a keeping track of battery lifetime parameters can help determine when to replace batteries.
寿命参数, 如循环总数、充电能量和剩余寿命等参数可用来确定何时应更换电池。为了节省经济效益,APP通常需要最少的飞行时间, 跟踪电池寿命参数可以帮助决定何时更换电池。

**Battery Aggregation**
**电池聚合**

Products requiring multiple batteries such as the M600 provide both parameters for single batteries, as well as for the aggregation. This aggregation is useful as a summary for how the multi-battery system is performing.
需要多块电池的无人机,如M600为一块电池和多块电池提供了两个参数。这种汇总作为多电池系统如何运行的总结非常有用。

A multi-battery system is as strong as its weakest link. Therefore for most efficiency, it's important to make sure all batteries in the system are performing similarly.
多电池系统的缺点在于多块同时使用。因此,要提高电池使用效率,就要确保系统中所有电池的性能都是相似的。

**Extreme Weather Durability**
**极端天气的耐久性**

Self-heating technology is built into Inspire 2's Intelligent Flight Batteries, allowing it to fly in temperatures as low as -4°F (-20°C).
Inspire 2的智能电池有自加热系统,使其能够在-20c的温度下飞行。
