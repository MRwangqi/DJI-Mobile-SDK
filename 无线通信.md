**Introduction**
**引言**

AirLink describes the wireless link between aircraft, remote controllers, handheld cameras and mobile devices.
介绍了无人机、遥控器、手持稳定器和手机之间的无线通信。

There are four types of wireless links used in DJI products:
在 DJI 无人机中有四种无线通信:

WiFi 
OcuSync 
Lightbridge
Auxiliary 

Wireless communication links provide great flexibility, but also have limitations. The link will degrade as obstacles come between the devices communicating wirelessly, as the separation between devices increases, and as interference with other communication links increases.
无线通信链路具有很大的灵活性,但也有局限性。随着设备之间的距离增加以及与其他通信链路的干扰增加，无线通信的设备之间出现障碍，链路将会降级。

A table detailing the type of wireless link for all aircraft products can be found in the Product Introduction.
详细介绍所有无人机无人机的无线链路类型的表格可以在无人机介绍中找到。

Osmo is not included in this table and uses the WiFi wireless link between itself and mobile device.
Osmo不包含在此表中,它使用自身与移动设备之间的WiFi连接。

**WiFi**
**无线网络**

WiFi is used as the wireless communication link for both aircraft and handheld camera products. In the case of aircraft, the remote controller acts as a WiFi access point (AP) and the aircraft and mobile device join it as clients. Some aircraft also act as the AP themselves, allowing the mobile device to connect directly. Similarly for Osmo, the mobile device joins the Osmo AP as a client.
无线网络被用作无人机和手持稳定器的无线通信链路。就无人机而言,遥控器充当WiFi发射端(AP),无人机和手机作为客户端加入它。 一些无人机也是自己的AP,允许手机直接连接。对于Osmo，移动设备作为客户端加入Osmo AP。

Aspects of the wireless link that can customized include:
可设置的无线链路配置包括:

SSID
Password 
WiFi Frequency Band (Osmo Only) 频率2.4G或者5G

OcuSync

Part of the Lightbridge family, DJI’s newly developed OcuSync transmission system performs far better than Wi-Fi transmission at all transmission speeds. OcuSync also uses more effective digital compression and channel transmission technologies, allowing it to transmit HD video reliably even in environments with strong radio interference. Compared to traditional analog transmission, OcuSync can transmit video at 720p and 1080p – equivalent to a 4-10 times better quality, without a color cast, static interference, flickering or other problems associated with analog transmission. Even when using the same amount of radio transmission power, OcuSync transmits further than analog at 4.1mi (7km)
作为Lightbridge系列的一部分，DJI新开发的OcuSync传输系统在所有传输速度下的性能都远远优于Wi-Fi传输。OcuSync还使用更高效的数字压缩和频道传输技术，即使在无线电干扰强的环境中也可以可靠传输高清视频。与传统的模拟信号传输相比，OcuSync能够以720p和1080p传输视频 - 提升4-10倍的质量，没有偏色，静电干扰，闪烁或与模拟传输相关的其他问题。相同的无线电传输功率下，OcuSync最远飞行传输距离4.1米（7公里）

Before taking off, OcuSync will automatically scan the environment and choose the frequency band with the lowest interference, ensuring more stable video transmission. During a flight, it sends key flight parameters back for viewing in the SDK and supports a maximum download speed of 40Mb/s for photos and videos.
在起飞前,OcuSync会自动扫描环境,选择干扰最小的频带,确保视频传输更加稳定。 在飞行过程中, 它将关键的飞行参数发送回SDK查看,并支持最大40mb/s的下载速度传输照片和视频。

In use, this is the difference between smooth or interrupted transmission, short or long flight range, and short or long recovery times after interference or GPS signal loss. Additionally, since Wi-Fi uses a traditional protocol stack, it takes longer - from several seconds to tens of seconds – to get connected and to re-connect after signal loss But OcuSync uses Cross-Layer Protocol Design, it can establish or re-establish links within one second.
在使用中，可以平滑的中断传输，短或长飞行距离，干扰或GPS信号丢失后恢复时长的差异。此外，由于Wi-Fi使用传统的协议栈，因此需要更长的时间（从几秒到几十秒）才能连接并在信号丢失后重新连接。但OcuSync使用跨层协议设计，在一秒之内建立链接。

As well as point-to-point video transmission, OcuSync also supports wireless connections to multiple devices. For example, you can connect the DJI Goggles, remote controller, and Mavic wirelessly to OcuSync all at the same time. You can also add an additional remote so that you can control the Mavic with two remotes or share First Person View (FPV) videos.
除了点对点视频传输以外,OcuSync还支持多种设备的无线通信。例如,您可以将 DJI眼镜、遥控器和Mavic无线连接到OcuSync。 您可以添加副控,方便使用两个遥控器控制Mavic或共享FPV视频。

**Lightbridge**

Lightbridge has been developed by DJI specifically for long range, robust aerial communication in the 2.4 GHz band, and is used as the link between remote controller and aircraft. It provides significantly more range than WiFi, with up to 5 km communication in some products.
DJI专门开发了Lightbridge，用于2.4 GHz频段的长距离，超高清的空中通信，并被用作遥控器与飞机之间的通讯链接。它提供的范围远远超过WiFi，在一些产品中通信距离可达5公里。

Lightbridge has 8 selectable channels. Channel selection can either be done manually, or left to the radio to determine what channel has the least interference. Data rate and channel quality can be measured to understand how channel is performing.
Lightbridge 有8个可选通道。信道选择可以手动完成,也可以留给无线电来确定哪个频道的干扰最小。可以测量数据速率和信道质量，以了解信道的表现。

Some remote controllers with Lightbridge wireless links also have a secondary video port. This port can be used to send the live stream in HDMI or SDI format to an external device.
一些带有Lightbridge无线通信的遥控器也有一个辅助视频端口。这个端口可以用来向外部设备发送HDMI或SDI格式的实时视频流。

**Lightbridge Accessory**
**Lightbridge 配件**

DJI also has a stand alone accessory product Lightbridge 2 that can be integrated into airframes such as the S1000. This product consists of a module that mounts on the aircraft, and a remote controller for ground control. The purpose of the product is to relay remote control commands to the aircraft, and relay telemetry and video data to the remote controller.
Dji有一个单独的配件产品Lightbridge2,可以集成到S1000这样的机身中。该配件包括一个装在无人机上的模块和一个用于地面控制的遥控器。该配件的目的是将远程控制指令转发给无人机,并将无人机遥测数据和视频数据转发给遥控器。

The accessory provides two additional features in the live video stream compared to ready-to-fly systems using Lightbridge technology:
与使用Lightbridge技术的现成产品系统相比,这个配件在实时视频流中提供了另外两个特性:

Multiple video inputs on the aircraft can be combined into a picture in picture live video stream 无人机上的多个视频输入可以组合成实时视频流画面

An on-screen-display (OSD) mode overlays aircraft attitude information onto the live video stream OSD将无人机姿态信息加载到到实时视频流中

**Picture in Picture**
**画中画**

The accessory provides several video inputs to accommodate an FPV (first person view) camera and a DJI HD camera and gimbal integration (like the Zenmuse X3 or X5). HDMI and AV ports are available for the FPV camera, and a HD gimbal port is available HD camera and gimbal integrations.
这个配件提供多种视频输入以适应FPV摄像头和DJI高清摄像头以及云台一体化（如ZenmuseX3或X5）。HDMI和AV端口可用于FPV摄像头，高清云台端口可用于高清摄像头和云台集成。

The video streams from both cameras can be combined into a single live stream with one stream inside the other in picture in picture or PIP mode. In this mode, one camera video is placed as a thumbnail in the video from the other camera.
两个摄像头的视频流可以合并成一个实时视频流,其中一个视频流在另一个视频流的画面中或PIP模式。在此模式下,一个摄像头视频作为缩略图放置在另一个摄像头的视频中。

**OSD - On Screen Display**
**Osd- 屏幕显示**

OSD is when real time aircraft state information (like altitude, attitude etc.) is overlaid on the live video stream. Using OSD can greatly simplify an FPV application as there is less need to process and display aircraft state through the application.
Osd是指无人机实时状态信息（如高度、姿态）等加载在实时视频流中。使用OSD可以大大简化FPV APP,因为不需要通过APP处理和显示无人机状态。

**Auxiliary**

WiFi and Auxiliary wireless links are used simultaneously between aircraft and remote controllers. The auxiliary link is a low bandwidth, but very robust link that carries control information critical to aircraft operation only. The WiFi link is higher bandwidth but is less robust and therefore carries application information and the live video stream.
WIFI和Auxiliary在无人机和遥控器之间同时使用。Auxiliary是一个低带宽,但是非常强大的链路, 携带无人机运行的关键控制信息。 WiFi带宽较高,但是不够健壮,因此可以携带APP信息和实时视频流。
