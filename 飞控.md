**Introduction**
**引言**

The flight controller is an onboard computer that combines control information from the pilot with sensor information to adjust the thrust at each propellor and fly the aircraft as desired.
飞控是一台机载计算机, 它将来自飞手的控制信息与传感器信息结合起来, 以调整每个动力的动力, 或者按照预期飞行。

The flight controller is responsible for:
飞控负责以下工作:

Flight control including motor control, taking off and landing, manual flight modes 
飞行控制, 包括电机控制, 起降, 手动飞行模式

Aircraft state information such as attitude, position, speed 
无人机状态信息, 如姿态, 位置, 速度

Sensor sub components such as compasses, IMUs, and positioning systems. 
传感器子组件, 如指南针、 IMUs 和定位系统

Aircraft sub components such as the landing gear 
无人机的次级部件, 如脚架

无人机飞行模拟器用于测试和调试

A general description of fundamental flight control concepts can be found here.
这里可以找到基本飞行控制概念的一般描述。

**State**
**状态信息**

The flight controller provides detailed state information at up to 10 Hz including:
该飞控提供最高达10赫兹的详细状态信息, 包括:

Aircraft position, velocity and altitude 
无人机位置、速度和高度

Remaining Battery and Flight time information 
剩余的电池和飞行时间信息

Home location 
起飞点的位置

Sensor information (compass, IMU, Satellite positioning) 
传感器信息(指南针、 IMU、卫星定位)

Return home status 
返航状态

Whether motors are on and aircraft is flying or not 
电机是否打开, 无人机是否飞行

Flight limitation and GEO system information 
限飞区和GEO信息系统

**Flying**
**飞行**

**Motor Control**
**电机控制**

Motors can be turned on and off through APIs in the DJI Mobile SDK. Motors can only be turned off when the aircraft is not flying. Motors will not turn on if there are IMU or Compass calibration errors, or if the IMU is still pre-heating.
通过DJI Mobile SDK中的api 可以打开和关闭电机。 只有当无人机不飞的时候, 电机才能关闭。 如果有 IMU 或者指南针校准错误, 或者 IMU 还处于预热状态, 那么电机就不会启动。

**Beginning and Ending Flights**
**开始和结束飞行**

Aircraft take-off and landing can be automated through APIs in the DJI Mobile SDK. Takeoff is considered complete when the aircraft is hovering 1.2 meters (4 feet) above the ground. Automatic take-off can only be initiated when the motors are off.
无人机起飞和降落可以通过 DJI Mobile SDK中的api实现自动化飞行。 当无人机在距地面1.2米高度盘旋时, 说明起飞完成。 一键起飞只能在电机关闭的时候使用。

When a automated land command is sent, the aircraft will descend at it's current position and land.
当使用一键降落时, 无人机将原地下降。

**Flight Control**
**飞行控制**

Aircraft flight can be controlled in several ways:
无人机飞行可以通过以下几种方式来控制:

Manually: Remote controller control sticks can be manipulated by the user 
手动控制: 遥控器摇杆由用户操纵

Missions: Simple high level flight automation 
智能飞行: 简单的自动飞行

Virtual Sticks: Stick commands can be sent using DJI Mobile SDK APIs that simulate manual flight. 
虚拟摇杆: 通过发送指令可以使用 DJI Mobile SDK api 来模拟手动飞行

Gestures: Some aircraft (e.g. Spark) will perform basic flight maneuvers based on a gesture from the user. 手势控制: 一些无人机(例如 Spark)将根据用户的手势进行基本的飞行控制

**Flight Orientation**
**飞行方向**

The remote controller control sticks can be used to move the aircraft forward, backwards, left and right. However, if the direction of the aircraft isn't obvious, it can be difficult to control the aircraft predictably from pilot's perspective on the ground.
遥控器摇杆可以用来向前、向后、左右移动无人机。 然而, 如果无人机的方向不明显, 从飞手的角度来看, 在地面上很难控制无人机。

Several flight orientation modes are available to make flying easier:
有几种飞行方向控制模式可以让飞行变得更容易:

Course Lock: The aircraft moves relative to a locked course heading. 
航向锁定: 无人机相对于一个锁定的航向而移动

Home Lock: The aircraft moves relative radially to the Home Point. 
返航点锁定: 无人机相对于返航点径向移动。

Aircraft Heading: The aircraft moves relative to the front of the aircraft. 
无人机自身航向: 无人机相对于无人机前部移动

More details are described in Flight Control Concepts.
更多细节见《飞行控制概念》。

**Flight Limitation**
**飞行限制**

Maximum aircraft altitude and distance from home location can be used to limit the area an aircraft can fly in. The DJI Mobile SDK provides APIs that allow developers to query and change these limitations.
限制高度和最远飞行距离可以用来限制无人机飞入的区域。 Mobile SDK  提供了 api, 允许开发者获取和更改这些限制。

**Geospatial Environment Online (GEO)**
**GEO地理空间信息系统**

The GEO system is a best-in-class geospatial information system that provides drone operators with information that will help them make smart decisions about where and when to fly. It combines up-to-date airspace information, a warning and flight-restriction system, a mechanism for unlocking (self-authorizing) drone flights in locations where flight is permitted under certain conditions, and a minimally-invasive accountability mechanism for these decisions.
GEO系统是最好的地理空间信息系统，提供无人机飞手的信息，这将有助于他们做出何时何地飞行的明智决定。它结合了实时的空域信息，警告和飞行限制系统，在特殊情况下允许解锁限飞区，以及针对这些特殊飞行的事故问责机制。

**Sensors**
**传感器**

The Flight controller manages several sub components of the aircraft including sensors and landing gear.
该控制器管理无人机的几个子部件, 包括传感器和脚架。

**Compass**
**指南针**

The compass measures magnetic field direction and is used to determine the heading of the aircraft relative to North. The compass sometimes needs to be calibrated if flying near magnetic interference. Compass calibration will require the user to rotate the aircraft vertically and horizontally through the azimuth. Products with multiple compasses (like the Phantom 4) will have their compass state fused into one compass class for simplicity.
指南针测量磁场方向, 用于确定无人机相对于北方的航向。 如果在磁场干扰附近飞行, 指南针有时需要校准。 指南针校准将要求使用者通过方位角垂直旋转和水平旋转无人机。 具有多个指南针(如精灵4)的无人机将使他们的指南针状态融合为一个指南针类, 以简化使用。

**IMU - Inertial Measurement Unit**
**Imu-惯性导航系统**

The IMU contains an accelerometer and gyroscope to measure linear acceleration and angular velocity. The IMU is a sensitive system that is dependent on temperature and sometimes requires recalibration. Preheating is done automatically by the aircraft, and its status can be monitored in the flight controller state data. Calibration can be initiated by DJI Mobile SDK APIs when required.
Imu 包含一个加速度计和陀螺仪来测量线性加速度和角速度。Imu是一个敏感的系统,它依赖于温度,有时需要重新校准。 IMU预热由无人机自动完成, 其状态可以在飞控状态数据中进行查看。 如有需要, 可通过DJI Mobile SDK api 进行校正。

Some products have more than one IMU for redundancy. The Phantom 4 has two IMUs, while the M600 can accommodate up to three.
有些无人机有一个以上的 IMU 用于冗余。 精灵4有两个 imu, 而 M600可以容纳多达3个。

**RTK Positioning System**
**Rtk 定位系统**

DJI Products come with built-in consumer satellite positioning systems that use GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations. Consumer grade satellite positioning can have position errors of several meters.
Dji 无人机配备内置的民用导航系统, 使用GPS和GLONASS，民用GPS可能有几米的位置误差。

The DJI DRTK positioning system is an accessory compatible with the M600 and A3 flight controller that allows centimeter level positioning. DRTK is a real time kinetic satellite positioning system that uses GPS+GLONASS or GPS+Beidou constellations (depending on DRTK model).
Dji DRTK 定位系统是与 M600和 A3飞控兼容的配件, 允许厘米级定位。 Drtk 是一个实时动态GPS, 它使用 gps + glonass 或 gps + beidou (取决于 DRTK 模型)系统的实时动态定位。

The system requires both a base station and mobile station receiver, which are connected together through a wireless link. The base station receiver is deployed at a known location on the ground, while the mobile station is deployed on the aircraft. Both base station and mobile station will experience similar satellite signal errors at the same time. As the base station is at a known location, it can send real time correction information to the mobile station, resulting in centimeter accurate positing information for the mobile station relative to the base station.
该系统需要一个移动基站和机载RTK天线, 它们通过无线链路连接在一起。 移动基站安装在地面上的已知位置, 而机载RTK安装在无人机上。 同时, 移动基站和机载RTK都会出现类似的卫星信号误差。 由于移动基站位于已知位置, 它可以向机载RTK发送实时校正信息, 从而得到相对于移动基站的厘米级定位信息。

The mobile station comes with two antennas which can be deployed on opposite sides of the aircraft. As the position of both antennas can be combined into a heading vector that can often be more accurate than compass heading in the environments with high magnetic field interference (like near large metal structures, or high voltage lines).
这个机载RTK有两个天线, 可以安装在无人机的两侧。 由于这两个天线的位置可以组合成一个航向向量, 在磁场干扰的环境中(比如靠近大型金属结构或高压线)的环境中往往更准确。

**Vision System and Intelligent Flight Assistant**
**计算机视觉系统和智能飞行助手**

Cameras can be used to detect obstacles and accurately determine relative position and velocity. These cameras are typically mounted on the product facing downward for positioning and forward for obstacle detection. They are separate from the main camera used to capture photos and videos.
摄像头可以用来探测障碍物并精准地确定相对位置和速度。 这些摄像头通常安装在无人机底部, 以便定位和前进, 以及检测障碍物。 它们和拍摄照片或视频的摄像头不同。

**Obstacle Avoidance**
**避障**

Some products have pairs of cameras that use stereo vision to determine the depth of an environment. For instance, the Mavic Pro has a pair of cameras facing to the front of the aircraft, while the Phantom 4 Professional has two pair of cameras facing to the front and rear. This vision system allows the aircraft to either stop in front of or go around obstacles in its flight path.
有些无人机有一对摄像头, 它们利用立体视觉系统来确定环境深度。 例如, Mavic Pro 有一对面向无人机前部的摄像头, 而 Phantom 4前后则有两对摄像头。 这种视觉系统允许无人机在飞行路线上暂停或绕过障碍物。

The vision system enables users to fly with increased comfort as there is lower probability they will make a mistake and impact an object. However, limitations of the system still need to be understood to fly safely. Objects that are difficult to detect are those that are small, very narrow, too plain in appearance (visual features can't be extracted), not in the field of view of both cameras, or too close or too far from the product (see product page ) for specifications).
计算机视觉系统使用户能够更加放心地飞行,因为他们撞机可能性较低。然而,计算机视觉系统的局限性仍然需要注意。难以被检测到的物体是那些微小的、非常窄的、外观过于简单(视觉特征无法提取) , 或者在两个摄像头的视野中, 但是离无人机太近或者离无人机太远(详情参考产品介绍页面)。

**Positioning**
**定位**

Downward facing cameras can help determine relative position and velocity more accurately than consumer satellite positioning systems. They can also be used to hover in GPS denied environments such as inside buildings.
相对于GPS, 底部摄像头可以更准确地确定相对位置和速度。也可以用来在没有GPS的环境中悬停，例如建筑物内部。

**Intelligent Flight Assistant**
**智能飞行助手**

The DJI Mobile SDK provides an Intelligent Flight Assistant that gives access to state information of the obstacle avoidance and positioning vision systems.
Dji Mobile SDK  提供了一个智能飞行助手, 该助手提供了避障和定位视觉系统的状态信息。

In addition, warning and distance information is available to developers for obstacles in front of the aircraft.
此外, 对于前视障碍, 开发者可以获得警告信息和距离信息。

**Landing Gear**
**脚架**

Some products have moveable landing gear that are deployed when landing to protect the camera, but can be raised (retracted) when flying to not impede the camera view.
有些无人机有可折叠的脚架, 这些脚架在降落时可以保护摄像头, 但是在飞行时可以折叠, 避免遮挡拍摄。

Landing gear can be deployed or retracted programmatically or automatically. When automatic, the flight controller will determine when to deploy the landing gear and when to retract it. In situations where a fast landing is required, it is better to programmatically deploy the landing gear so the aircraft doesn't have to pause at a height close to the ground to trigger the automatic process.
脚架可以自动折叠或放下。飞控决定何时放下脚架,何时折叠脚架。在快速降落的时候,最好使用自动放下脚架,这样无人机就可以自动放下脚架而不必在接近地面前悬停。

**Transport mode**
**运输模式**

In transport mode, the landing gear will be in the same geometric plane as the aircraft body so it can be easily transported.
在运输模式下, 脚架将与无人机机身处于相同的几何平面上, 以便于运输。

**Flight Time and Battery Thresholds**
**飞行时间和低电量报警**

Aircraft flight time is determined by total aircraft mass, the available stored (battery) energy on the aircraft, the environment the aircraft is flying in, and how the aircraft is being flown. Flying fast against strong wind with a heavy payload will have a shorter flight time than hovering in no wind with a light payload.
无人机飞行时间取决于无人机总重量、无人机上可用的电池、无人机的飞行环境以及无人机的飞行方式。 在强风的情况下, 携带重载荷的飞行时间要比没有风的情况下携带少量载荷的飞行时间短。

During a flight, the flight controller and smart battery will work together to estimate the remaining time of the current flight based on data collected during the flight. It will also provide estimates for the the battery percentage required to return home from the current location, or land immediately.
在飞行过程中,飞控和智能电池将根据在飞行过程中收集的数据,共同估计当前飞行的剩余时间。它还将提供从目前地点返航或立即降落所需的电量。

In addition, two manual battery thresholds can be set that will automate aircraft behavior when the battery is running low.
此外, 还可以设置两个低电量报警, 以便在电池耗尽时指定无人机的行为。

Return to home: The threshold is usually set between 25% and 50%, and will automatically initiate a return to home warning if the threshold is crossed. If no action is taken within 10s, then the aircraft will automatically return home. The return home can be cancelled by pressing the Return Home button on the remote controller. 
飞行时: 低电量报警通常设置在25% 到50% 之间, 如果低于低电量报警值, 它将自动启动返航警告。 如果10秒内没有采取任何行动, 那么无人机就会自动返航。通过按遥控器上的返航按钮, 可以取消返航。

Land in place: The threshold is usually set between 10% and 25%, and will immediately land the aircraft if crossed. 
原地降落: 低电量报警值通常设定在10% 到25% 之间, 如果超过报警值, 将立即原地降落

**Returning Home**
**返航**
The aircraft can automatically return-to-home (RTH) in a number of scenarios:
无人机可以在以下几种情况下自动返航(RTH) :

Smart RTH: Commanded to by the pilot through the application or the remote controller 
智能返航: 由飞手通过APP或遥控器操作

Failsafe RTH: If the wireless link is lost between the remote controller and aircraft 
失联返航: 如果遥控器和无人机之间丢失了无线通信

Low Battery RTH: If the battery drops below a threshold that is enough to get home, but not enough to require immediate emergency landing 
低电量返航:如果电量降到低电量返航值以下, 但没触发原地降落

When automatically going home, the aircraft will rise to a minimum altitude, fly to the home location (home point) using GPS positioning, then land.
自动返航时, 无人机会升到最低返航高度, 使用 GPS 定位飞往返航点,然后降落。

The home point is automatically set as the location the aircraft first takes off from after power on. After that, the home point can be updated through APIs in the DJI Mobile SDK but is limited to being within 30m of initial take-off location, current aircraft's location, current mobile location, or current remote controller's location (for remote controllers with GPS capability).
返航点被自动设置为无人机第一次起飞后的位置。 在此之后,可以通过 DJI Mobile SDK  中的 api 进行更新, 但仅限于最初起飞位置的30米以内,当前无人机的位置,当前的移动位置,或当前遥控器的位置(带GPS的遥控器)。

Note: If the GPS signal is not sufficient during take-off to record a home location, the home point will be recorded when the GPS signal is strong enough. When taking off in poor satellite signal environments, developers should ensure the home point being set is within the user's expectations.
注意: 如果起飞时GPS信号不足，无法记录返航点, 那么当GPS信号良好时就会记录返航点。当在GPS信号不好的地方起飞时, 开发人员应该确保设置的返航点在用户的期望之内。

**Smart RTH**
**智能返航**

Press the Return Home button on the remote controller to initiate Smart RTH. The aircraft will then automatically return to the last recorded Home Point.
按遥控器上的返航按钮来启动智能返航。 然后无人机会自动返回到最后一个记录的起飞点。

The remote controller's control sticks can be used to change the aircraft's position to avoid a collision during the Smart RTH process. Press and hold the button once to start the process, and press the button again to terminate the procedure and regain full control of the aircraft.
遥控器的摇杆可以用来改变无人机的位置,以避免在智能返航过程中发生碰撞。按住按钮一次,开始执行,再次按下按钮终止程序和恢复对无人机的完全控制。

Smart RTH can also be initiated and cancelled through the DJI Mobile SDK.
智能返航 也可以通过 DJI Mobile SDK 启动和停止。

**Failsafe RTH**
**失联返航**

If the Home Point was successfully recorded and the compass is functioning normally, Failsafe RTH will be automatically activated if the remote controller signal is lost for more than three seconds. The RTH process may be interrupted and the operator may regain control of the aircraft if the remote controller signal connection is re-established.
如果返航点被成功地记录下来并且指南针运行正常, 如果遥控器信号丢失超过三秒钟, 失联返航将自动启动。 如果重新建立遥控器信号连接,失联返航程序可能中断, 飞手可恢复对无人机的控制。

In some missions, it is not desirable to immediately return home when signal connection is lost. Failsafe behavior can be configured using DJI Mobile SDK APIs.
在一些任务, 如果失去信号连接, 不宜立即返航。 可以使用 DJI Mobile SDK api 来配置失联返航行为。

**Low Battery RTH**
**低电量返航**

When the battery drops below a certain threshold (typically 25% to 50%), the aircraft will request to come home. When it does so, the DJI Mobile SDK APIs that monitor flight controller state will be updated to include this request, and at the same time the remote controller will start beeping.
当电池低于一定的报警值(通常是25% 到50%)时, 无人机会要求返航。当低电量返航时,监视飞控状态的 DJI Mobile SDK api 将会更新, 以回调这个请求, 同时遥控器将开始发出哔哔声。

The RTH procedure can be cancelled by either pressing the home button on the remote controller, or sending a cancel command through the application using the SDK.
可以按返航键来取消低电量返航过程, 也可以通过使用 SDK 的APP发送取消命令。

**Loss of Wireless Link**
**无线链路丢失**

The wireless connection between the remote controller and aircraft can sometimes be lost when the distance is too great, or obstacles impede the link.
当距离太远时,遥控器和无人机之间的无线通信有时会丢失, 或者障碍物阻挡了链接。

If the link is lost for 3 seconds, the aircraft will start performing a failsafe behavior. Behavior options include:
如果链接丢失了3秒钟, 无人机将开始执行故障保护的动作。 动作选项包括:

Automatically returning home 
自动返航(详情参照Returning Home)

Hovering in position 
原地悬停

Landing in position 
原地下降

**Onboard SDK Communication**
**机载 SDK 通信**

Applications using the DJI Mobile SDK can communicate with DJI Onboard SDK applications deployed on the aircraft over the Lightbridge wireless communication link.
使用DJI Mobile SDK的应用程序可以通过Lightbridge无线通信链路与飞机上安装的DJI Onboard SDK应用程序进行通信。

The DJI Mobile SDK gives developers the ability to detect if an Onboard SDK application is connected to the flight controller, and both send and receive data to it. The size of the data cannot be greater than 100 bytes, and will be sent in 40 byte increments every 14ms.
Mobile SDK  为开发人员提供了一种能力, 可以检测到Onboard SDK 应用程序是否连接到飞控, 同时向它发送和接收数据。 数据的大小不能超过100字节, 并且每14ms 将以40字节的增量发送。

**Simulator**
**模拟器**

DJI aircraft flight controllers support a simulation mode for faster, safer development of applications. The flight controller accept control commands, and use them to simulate sensor and state information. Applications can be tested in the simulator first before taking the products into the field.
Dji 无人机飞控支持模拟器模式, 以便更快、更安全地开发APP。 飞控接受控制命令, 并使用它们来模拟传感器和状态信息。 在实际飞行前，可以先在模拟器中测试应用程序。

The simulator can be started and stopped using the DJI Mobile SDK. Programatic control of the simulator means continuous integration environments can leverage the simulator to do comprehensive application testing every time an application is built.
使用DJI MobileSDK可以启动和停止模拟器。可编程交互的模拟器意味着开发环境可以利用模拟器在每次构建应用程序时进行全面的应用程序测试。

A windows application (and for P4 a mac application) can be used to visualize the simulated flight. More details on using the simulator are here.
windows程序(以及对于P4的mac程序)可以用来可视化模拟飞行。 有关使用模拟器的更多细节在这里。

**Virtual Sticks**
**虚拟操纵杆**

Virtual stick functions in the DJI Mobile SDK simulate the remote controller's joysticks, and therefore an aircraft can be automated to fly in any way a human can manually fly it. Compared to missions, this is a more complicated, but flexible way to automate flight.
DJI Mobile SDK 中的虚拟操纵杆函数模拟遥控器的操纵杆,因此无人机可以自动飞行,与智能飞行相比, 这是一个更复杂,但是灵活的编程飞行方式。

The virtual stick APIs have several modes of operation that are important to understand.
虚拟操纵杆 api 有几种重要的操作模式需要理解。

**Coordinate System**
**坐标系**

Either Ground or Body coordinate system can be chosen. All horizontal movement commands (X, Y, pitch, roll) will be relative to the coordinate system.

可以选择地面或自身坐标系。 所有的水平移动命令(x, y, pitch, roll)都是相对于坐标系的。

**Roll Pitch Control Mode**
**横滚俯仰控制模式**

Virtual stick commands to move the aircraft horizontally can either be set with X/Y velocities, or roll/pitch angles. Larger roll and pitch angles result in larger Y and X velocities respectively. Roll and pitch angles are always relative to the horizontal. Roll and pitch directions are dependent on the coordinate system, and can be confusing. For convenience a table detailing how the aircraft moves depending on coordinate system and roll pitch control mode is given below. These can all be calculated using the definition of the coordinate systems.
虚拟操纵命令可以水平移动无人机, 可以设置 x / y 速度, 或者横滚/俯仰角。 较大的横滚角和俯仰角分别导致较大的 y 和 x 速度。 横滚和俯仰角始终相对于水平面。 横滚和俯仰的方向取决于坐标系, 而且可能会造成混淆。 为了方便起见, 下面提供了一个表格, 详细说明无人机根据坐标系和俯仰控制模式的运动方式。 这些都可以用坐标系的定义来计算。

**Yaw Control Mode**
**偏航控制模式**

Yaw can be changed by either angle or velocity. Yaw settings are independent of the coordinate system. Positive yaw velocity will always rotate clockwise, and yaw angle is always relative to North.
偏航可以通过角度或速度改变。偏航设置与坐标系无关。正偏航速度总是顺时针方向旋转, 偏航角始终与北方相对应。

**Vertical Throttle Control Mode:**
**垂直油门控制模式:**

Vertical movement can be achieved either using velocity or position. Position is an altitude relative to the take-off location. Velocity is always relative to the aircraft, and does not follow typical coordinate system convention (positive vertical velocity results in the aircraft ascending).
垂直运动可以通过速度或者位置来实现。 位置是相对起飞位置的一个高度。 速度总是相对于无人机, 并不遵循典型的坐标系(正向垂直速度导致无人机上升)。
