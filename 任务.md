**Introduction**
**引言**

Missions can be used to easily automate flight. There are many different mission types that offer different product behavior. Some missions can be uploaded to and managed by the aircraft, while other missions are managed from the mobile device.
任务可以用来轻松实现飞行自动化。有许多不同的任务类型。一些任务可以上传到无人机上并由无人机管理,而其他任务则由手机管理。

Missions run from the mobile device can offer more complex or customizable behavior, however if the wireless link between remote controller and aircraft is lost then they can be interrupted. In comparison, missions run from the aircraft will be less customizable and be limited by aircraft memory, but be able to continue when there is a loss in the wireless link.
从手机运行的任务可以提供更复杂或者可定制的行为,但是如果遥控器和无人机之间的无线链路丢失了,那么它们可能被中断。 相比之下,从无人机上运行的任务将不太容易定制,并受到无人机内存的限制,但是当无线链路出现丢失时能够继续执行。

**Mission Control**
**任务控制**

Mission Control handles execution of missions. Either single missions can be run through dedicated mission operators, or a series of missions and actions can be run serially using the Timeline.
任务可以用来轻松实现飞行自动化。有许多不同的任务类型提供不同的飞行行为。有些任务可以上传到飞机上进行管理，而其他任务则由手机进行管理。

**Waypoint Mission**
**航点任务**

A waypoint mission is a series of pre-defined locations (waypoints) the aircraft will fly to. A location is a latitude, longitude and altitude. Aircraft heading and altitude between waypoints can change either gradually or at the waypoint itself. A series of actions (such as take photo) can be executed at each waypoint.
航点任务是一系列预先确定的位置(航点),位置包含纬度,经度和高度。无人机在航点之间的航向和高度可以逐渐改变, 也可以在某个航点改变。一系列的动作(如拍照)可以在每个航点执行。

During the mission, the mission can be manually adjusted using the remote controller control sticks. The mission speed can be sped up, slowed down or even executed in reverse.
在任务执行期间,可以使用遥控器摇杆手动调整飞行任务。任务速度可以加快,减慢甚至反向执行。

A Waypoint Mission is uploaded to and executed by the aircraft, but is limited by the amount of storage in the flight controller. Accordingly only 99 waypoints can be executed per mission.
航点任务上传到飞机并由飞机执行，但受到飞控中内存的限制。因此，每个任务只能执行99个航点。

**Hot Point Mission**
**兴趣点环绕**

In a Hot Point Mission, the aircraft will repeatedly fly circles of a constant radius around a specified point called a Hot Point. Altitude, velocity, the Hot Point location, aircraft heading and flight direction can all be defined as part of the mission.
在兴趣点环绕任务中,无人机会在一个叫做兴趣点的周围环绕飞行。 高度、速度、兴趣点位置、无人机航向和飞行方向都可以定义为任务的一部分。

Altitude, heading and radius can also be adjusted manually using the remote controller control sticks during the mission.
在执行任务期间,还可以使用遥控器摇杆手动调整飞行高度、航向和半径。

**Follow Me Mission**

In a Follow Me Mission, the aircraft will follow GPS coordinates continually sent to the aircraft maintaining separation and a constant altitude.
在Follow Me任务中,无人机将跟踪遥控器不断地发送到无人机的GPS坐标保持距离和恒定的高度。

The aircraft will hover in place if it hasn't received a new GPS coordinate for more than 6 seconds.
如果无人机没有接收到新的GPS坐标超过6秒钟,无人机将原地悬停。

**ActiveTrack Mission**
**智能跟随**

The ActiveTrack Mission allows an aircraft to track a moving subject using the vision system and without a GPS tracker on the subject.
智能跟随允许无人机使用跟踪移动目标,而不使用GPS。

User defines a rectangle on the live video view that defines the subject to track. 用户在实时视频视图中定义一个矩形,定义要跟踪的目标

The rectangle is sent to the aircraft, and which will start to track the object 
矩形目标被发送到无人机上,它将开始跟踪该对象

The aircraft will send back real-time updates of the rectangle tracking what it thinks is the subject and ask for confirmation it is tracking correctly 
无人机将返回它认为的视觉目标,并请求确认跟踪这个目标

On confirmation, the aircraft will start to move with the subject, following it while tracking 
确认后,无人机将开始跟踪目标

If the tracking algorithm loses confidence it is tracking the subject correctly the aircraft will return to a hover and ask for confirmation about the subject again 
如果跟踪算法丢失跟随目标,无人机将立即悬停,并请求再次确认该目标

During the mission, the main camera is used to track the object and so the gimbal cannot be controlled by the user or application. The aircraft can be flown manually with pitch, roll and throttle stick commands from the remote controller to move the aircraft around the subject being tracked.
在任务期间,主摄像头用于跟踪对象,因此云台不能由用户或APP控制。这架无人机可以用遥控器的俯仰、横滚和油门操纵杆命令手动飞行, 以围绕正在跟踪的目标飞行。

There are three modes of the Active Track Mission:
智能跟随有三种模式:

Trace Mode
跟随模式

The aircraft follows behind or in front of the subject keeping a constant distance. Some products like Mavic Pro also support a Gesture Mode and the ability to circle the subject. Gesture mode allows the subject to confirm tracking as well as take pictures using gestures.
无人机跟在目标后面或前面,保持一定的距离。Mavic Pro也支持手势模式和环绕跟随拍摄的功能。手势模式允许无人机确认跟踪, 以及使用手势拍照。

Profile Mode
平行模式

Aircraft moves in parallel with the subject instead of behind.
无人机与目标平行移动,而不是后面。

Spotlight Mode
锁定模式

Aircraft's camera will automatically follow the subject, but the aircraft does not automatically keep a constant distance with the subject. You can use the remote controller to control the aircraft move around the subject being tracked.
无人机的摄像头会自动跟踪目标,但无人机不会自动与目标保持恒定的距离。您可以使用遥控器来控制无人机在被跟踪的目标周围的移动。

**TapFly Mission**
**指点飞行**

The TapFly mission flies the aircraft in the direction of a point on the live video stream that the user chooses. The mission is initialized with a position target from the live video stream. The 3D direction of the coordinate is calculated, and the aircraft proceeds to fly in that direction. The aircraft can automatically avoid obstacles when the scene is sufficiently illuminated (more than 300 lux but less than 10,000 lux). The aircraft stops flying in the direction if it reaches its radius limitation, the mission is stopped, the user pulls back on the pitch stick or if it comes to an obstacle it cannot bypass.
指点飞行将无人机飞向用户在屏幕中选择的一个点。这个任务是从屏幕中识别出目标位置。计算出坐标的三维方向, 无人机朝着这个方向飞行。光照充足时,无人机可以自动避障(超过300勒克斯, 但不到10,000勒克斯)。 如果无人机达到了它的限制半径,任务停止,飞手拉回推杆,或者如果它遇到了无法绕过的障碍物。

The Remote Controller yaw stick can be used to adjust the heading of the aircraft during mission execution, which also adjusts the direction of flight to the new yaw.
遥控器偏航杆可用于调整无人机在执行任务期间的飞行方向,同时还可调整飞行方向以适应新的航向。

TapFly is only supported on newer aircraft with vision systems.
Tapfly 只支持拥有的新型无人机。

For Phantom 4 Professional, there are three TapFly modes:
对于 Phantom 4 Pro来说, TapFly 有三种模式:

TapFly Forward – Aircraft will fly towards the target. Forward Obstacle Sensing System is active. 
Tapfly Forward-无人机将飞向目标。前视避障系统运行

TapFly Backward – Aircraft will fly in the opposite direction from the target. Backward Obstacle Sensing System is active. 
Tapfly Backward 无人机将飞向目标的相反方向。后视避障系统运行

TapFly Free – Aircraft will fly towards the target. User can control the heading with the remote controller's stick. Obstacle Sensing Systems may fail to work when aircraft is flying sidewards. 
Tapfly Free 无人机将飞向目标。用户可以用遥控器的操纵杆来控制航向。当无人机侧飞时,避障系统可能无法工作
