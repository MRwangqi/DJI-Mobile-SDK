**How to Capture a Picture**
**如何拍摄图片**

To understand the photography concepts of exposure, aperture, shutter, ISO and focal length it can be useful to consider how a picture is captured.
为了理解曝光、光圈、快门、 ISO 和焦距等摄影概念, 思考如何拍摄照片会很有帮助。

**Capture Light**
**捕获光线**

When light is incident on an object, it will usually scatter or reflect in all directions.
当光线入射到物体上时，它通常会散射或反射到各个方向。
![](https://devcn.djicdn.com/images/camera-concepts/IncidentLightSingleSource-eba049353e.gif)

The animation shows just two incident light beams on an object, effectively illuminating two features. In reality light is incident on the entire object, with all light from all features being scattered into space. A single point in space in front of the object will receive light from all features it can see - overlaid on each other. However the simplification of just a few object features being illuminated is easier to visualize.
动画只显示了一个物体上的两个入射光束，有效照亮了两个特征。实际上，光线会照射到整个物体上，所有特征的所有光线都会散射到空间中。物体前方空间中的单个点将接收它可以看到的所有特征的光线彼此重叠。然而，只有少数被照明的物体特征的简化更容易可视化。

Therefore with the exception of active light sources (like a light bulb, computer display or the sun), seeing an object means seeing the light reflected from it.
因此, 除了主动光源(如灯泡、计算机显示器或太阳)外, 看到一个物体就意味着看到反射的光。

To capture a picture, a device that is sensitive to and can record light is needed (a light sensor). In digital cameras, this device is a rectangular piece of silicon that has a grid of light detectors on it. Each light detector records how much light is incident on it, and is a single pixel in your final picture.
为了拍摄图片, 需要一种对光敏感且可以记录光线的设备(光传感器)。 在数码摄像头中, 这个设备是一个长方形的硅片, 上面有一个光探测器网格。 每一个光探测器都会记录下它上面的光是多少, 并且是最终图片中的单个像素。

However, if you just put the sensor next to the object you want to capture a picture of, you won't recognize the resulting picture. As each pixel can see each feature of the object, then each pixel will almost look the same.
但是，如果您只将传感器放置在被拍摄照片物体旁边，则无法辨别所得到的照片。由于每个像素都可以看到对象的每个特征，因此每个像素几乎看起来都是一样的。

The image becomes a constant color of all light combined:
这幅图像变成了所有光线组合的恒定颜色:

**Resolve the Image**
**解析图像**

To resolve the image, it is required that light from each feature of the scene only hit one small part of the sensor, or one pixel. This can be achieved by covering the sensor and putting a small hole or aperture in the cover to let light through.
为了解决图像的问题, 需要来自场景每个特征的光线只能击中传感器的一小部分或者一个像素。 这可以通过盖住传感器, 在盖子上放一个小孔或光圈让光线通过。
![](https://devcn.djicdn.com/images/camera-concepts/IntroduceAperture-49ebf85528.gif)

Now, each pixel of the sensor, sees a different part of the scene, and therefore the picture will be completely recognizable, though also upside down.
现在, 每个像素的传感器, 看到一个不同的部分场景, 因此图片将被完全识别, 虽然是上下颠倒的。

When very small, the aperture restricts the amount of light hitting the sensor to a minimum, but also lets the camera capture the entire scene in focus, as each pixel can only see a small part (feature) of the scene.
当光圈非常小时，光圈会将传感器上的光量限制在最小，但也可以让摄像头捕捉整个场景，因为每个像素只能看到场景的一小部分（特征）。

**Capture Time**
**拍摄时间**

If the camera or the scene moves a little bit, the features will be captured by a different pixel. This spreading of the features over multiple pixels will start to blur the image, and significant movement will once again make the picture completely unrecognizable.
如果摄像头或场景稍微移动一点,特征将被不同的像素捕获。这种特征在多个像素上的散布将开始模糊图像,而明显的运动将再次使图像完全无法识别。

Therefore, the sensor can only be exposed to the scene for a short period of time. The shorter this period of time, the less chance the image will be blurred, as the less relative motion the scene or camera will have.
因此, 传感器只能在短时间内暴露在场景中。 这段时间越短,场景或摄像头的相对运动就越少，而图像变得模糊的可能性就越小。

Between the sensor and the aperture is a shutter. The shutter is normally shut, blocking all light to the sensor. It will momentarily open and close, exposing the sensor to the light from the scene for a brief period of time.
传感器和光圈之间是一个快门。快门通常是关闭的,阻止所有的光线到传感器。它会暂时打开和关闭,在短时间内将传感器暴露在场景的光线中。

Light sensitive material, a shutter and a small aperture is all that's required to capture an image and is the basis of a simple camera.
光敏硅片, 快门和小孔是拍摄照片所需要的必备材料, 是一个简单摄像头的基础组成部分。

**Exposure**
**曝光**

As mentioned previously, each pixel of the sensor is a light detector. The more light that the pixel is exposed to, the brighter the pixel will be in the resulting picture. A picture that is too dark, means the sensor has been exposed to too little light, and often is called an under exposed picture. A picture that is too light, is often called over exposed.
如前所述, 传感器的每个像素都是一个光探测器。 像素暴露的光线越多, 照片中的像素就越明亮。 太暗的图片, 意味着传感器暴露在太少的光线下, 通常被称为未曝光的照片。 一幅太亮的照片, 常常被称为过度曝光。

![](images/曝光.PNG)

One of the keys to a great, recognizable picture is to get the exposure just right. Not too dark, not too light. If the shutter is opened and closed very quickly, the aperture is very small and the scene is not well lit, then each pixel will only be exposed to a small amount of light and the resulting picture may be under exposed.
一张好照片的关键之一就是正确地获得曝光。 不要太黑, 也不要太亮。 如果快速打开和关闭快门, 光圈非常小, 场景照明不足, 那么每个像素只会暴露在少量的光线下, 结果照片可能会曝光不足。

Exposure is usually described in stops, which is a relative measure where one stop describes a doubling or halving of light. Increasing the exposure by one stop is achieved by doubling the amount of light on the sensor.
曝光通常用光圈来描述,这是一个相对的测量,其中一个光圈描述了光的加倍或减半。通过使传感器上的光量增加一倍来实现一次停止曝光。

Thinking about exposure in stops is convenient when using different methods to control the exposure. Doubling the light (increasing the exposure by one stop) with method A can be compensated for by halving the light (decreasing the exposure by one stop) with method B.
当使用不同的方法来控制曝光时, 考虑停止曝光是很方便的。 用方法 a 将光线加倍(增加曝光量一次)可以用方法 b 将光线减半(使曝光量减少一次)来补偿。

So, how can exposure be changed?
那么, 如何改变曝光率呢？

**Shutter Speed**
**快门速度**

How long the shutter stays open controls how much light is incident on the sensor in time. Therefore a slower (longer) shutter speed will increase the exposure while a faster (shorter) shutter speed will decrease the exposure.
快门保持开启的时间控制了传感器上的光线是多少。 因此, 较慢(较长)的快门速度会增加曝光速度, 而较快(较短)的快门速度将减少曝光。

While a slower shutter speed will increase exposure, the trade-off is potential blur in the image due to scene or camera movement. The two pictures below have fast moving (propellors) and slow moving (aircraft body) features. The image of the propellors blur when there is a slow shutter speed, and are sharp when there is a fast shutter speed.
虽然较慢的快门速度会增加曝光率, 但由于场景或摄像头的移动, 折衷方案可能会导致图像模糊。 下面的两张图片有快速移动(螺旋桨)和缓慢移动(无人机身体)特征。 当快门速度变慢时, 螺旋桨的图像会变得模糊, 当快门速度很快的时候, 螺旋桨的形状就会变得模糊。

![](images/快门速度.PNG)

Note: Changing the shutter speed by itself also changes the exposure. To make both images have the same exposure, another exposure control method (ISO) was changed to compensate. ISO is described in the next section.
注意: 改变快门速度本身也改变曝光。 为了使两幅图像都具有相同的曝光率, 另一种曝光控制方法(ISO)被使用。 下一节将介绍 ISO。

Shutter speed is usually measured in seconds. As an example, DJI's Zenmuse X5 camera has a shutter speed range of 1/8000 seconds (fast) to 8 seconds (slow).
快门速度通常以秒为单位。 例如, DJI 的 Zenmuse X5摄像头的快门速度为1 / 8000秒(快)至8秒(慢)。

If the shutter is open for twice the amount of time, then exposure is doubled. Therefore doubling or halving shutter speed is the equivalent of increasing or decreasing the exposure by one stop.
如果快门打开的时间是曝光时间的两倍, 那么曝光量就会增加一倍。 因此, 将快门速度加倍或减半相当于增加或减少曝光一次。

**ISO**

Another way to increase exposure is to amplify the light detector reading on the sensor (effectively increase the light detector sensitivity). As the reading is amplified, the resulting pixel brightness will increase, and therefore exposure increases.
另一种增加曝光的方法是放大传感器上的光探测器读数(有效地增加光探测器的灵敏度)。 随着读数的放大,由此产生的像素亮度将增加, 因此曝光增加。

However, the light detector reading is never perfect. Electronics have a small amount of noise in them which will make small changes to the reading. Sometimes the reading will be a little brighter than it should be, other times a little darker. If the light reading is much stronger than the noise changes, then the noise (small fluctuations in exposure between adjacent pixels) won't be noticeable. However, as the light reading becomes weaker, then the noise fluctuations will become obvious.
然而, 光电探测器的读数从来都不是完美的。 电子产品中有一小部分噪点会对读数产生微小的影响。 有时候读数会比预想的要亮一些, 有时候会更暗一些。 如果光线读数比噪声变化强烈得多, 那么噪声(相邻像素之间的曝光波动)将不明显。 然而, 当光线读数变弱时, 噪声波动就会变得明显。

Any amplification will not just amplify low light detector readings, but also amplify the noise in the readings, making these exposure fluctuations obvious.
任何放大都不仅会放大低光探测器的读数, 还会放大读数中的噪点, 使这些曝光波动明显。

This is especially the case for an image of a smooth, simple surface. Instead of all the pixels being the same exposure, they will all be a little different, which will result in a grainy effect (as you can now distinguish each pixel).
这种情况尤其适用于光滑、简单的表面图像。 而不是所有的像素都是相同的曝光, 他们都会有一点不同, 这将导致颗粒效应(现在你可以区分每个像素)。

Pixel amplification is called ISO. Increasing ISO will increase exposure, but will also make the noise in the image more noticeable resulting in grainy pictures. Typically ISO is set as low as possible to achieve the cleanest image and is used to increase exposure as a last resort.
像素放大被称为 ISO。 增加 ISO 会增加曝光量, 但也会使图像中的噪点更加明显, 从而产生模糊的图片。 通常 ISO 设置为尽可能低, 以实现最干净的图像, 并被用来增加曝光作为最后的手段。

In the two pictures below (demonstrating shutter speed difference), the ISO was used to compensate for the change in exposure from the shutter. If you zoom in on the images, the noise in the high ISO image is noticeable, especially on the blue background.
在下面的两张照片(展示快门速度的差异)中, ISO 被用来补偿快门曝光的变化。 如果你放大图像, 高 ISO图像中的噪点是显而易见的, 尤其是在蓝色背景下。

![](images/iso.PNG)

Note: All concepts here apply to both greyscale (monochrome) and color sensors. A color sensor is simply a greyscale sensor that has a color filter in front of it. The color filter is a film with a grid of filters that line up with each pixel. Each filter will only let through one color of light: red, green or blue. The light detector or pixel behind each filter is then only detecting the strength of the light with the specific color and can be thought of as a red, green or blue pixel.
注意: 这里所有的概念都适用于灰度(单色)和颜色传感器。 颜色传感器只是一个灰度传感器, 前面有一个颜色过滤器。 颜色过滤器是一个带有滤镜网格的胶片, 它与每个像素一起排列。 每个滤镜只能透过一种颜色的光线: 红色、绿色或蓝色。 每个滤镜后面的光探测器或像素只能检测到特定颜色的光的强度, 可以被认为是红色, 绿色或蓝色像素。

If a picture is taken of a black scene, then the result should be very little red, green and blue light detected. If the exposure of the image is increased using amplification (ISO), then the red, green and blue pixels will all get brighter, but to slightly different levels. This means the combination of red, green, blue pixels will no longer be black, but instead be slightly red, green or blue depending on which pixel had more additive noise.
如果拍摄的是黑色场景, 那么结果应该是非常少的红色, 绿色和蓝色的光线。 如果使用放大(ISO)来增加图像的曝光度, 那么红色、绿色和蓝色的像素就会变得更亮, 但是水平会略有不同。 这意味着红色, 绿色, 蓝色像素的组合将不再是黑色, 而是略微的红色, 绿色或蓝色取决于哪个像素有更多的附加噪点。

As an example of ISO, DJI's Zenmuse X5 has an ISO range from 100 (low noise) to 25600 (high noise). The ISO number is proportional to the amount of light the sensor is exposed to. Doubling the ISO is the same as increasing the exposure by one stop.
例如, DJI 的 Zenmuse X5有一个 ISO 范围从100(低噪点)到25600(高噪点)。 Iso 数字与感光元件暴露的光线量成正比。 将 ISO 增加一倍与一站式增加曝光是一样的。

**Aperture**
**光圈**

Another way to increase exposure is to increase the aperture.
另一种增加曝光的方法是增加光圈。

Aperture is usually described with f-numbers (also called f-stops) where f/1.4 is a large aperture and f/22 is a small aperture.
光圈通常用 f-数字(也称为 f-stop)来描述, f / 1.4是一个大光圈, f / 22是一个小光圈。

The f-number (N) is formally the ratio of the lens 


Customarily it is written as f/N (which is the equation above rearranged) and describes the diameter of the lens 
通常它被写成 f / n (这是上面重新排列的等式) , 并描述镜头的直径

To double the amount of light, the aperture area must be doubled 
为了使光量增加一倍, 光圈面积必须加倍

As the aperture is a circle, doubling the aperture area increases the diameter by a factor of 1.414 (square root of 2) 
由于光圈是一个圆, 光圈面积增加一倍, 直径增加1.414(2的算术平方根)

Therefore to change an aperture by one exposure stop, the f-number is changed by 1.414 
因此, 为了通过一个曝光停止来改变光圈, f-值改变为1.414

D is inversely proportional to N, thus a larger N will describe a smaller D 
D 与 n 成反比, 因此较大的 n 表示较小的 d

Compared to an aperture of f/1.4, f/2 is an aperture of half the area (f/1.4*1.414) and therefore one stop smaller. 
与光圈 f / 1.4相比, f / 2是光圈的一半(f / 1.4 * 1.414) , 因此一个光圈较小

However as shown previously, as the aperture increases each pixel will see more than one feature in the scene, causing the picture to be increasingly out of focus.
然而, 如上图所示, 随着光圈的增大, 每个像素都会在场景中看到多个特征, 使得图片越来越无法对焦。

A lens can be used to bring parts of the scene back into focus.
可以使用镜头来让场景的某些部分重新聚焦。
![](https://devcn.djicdn.com/images/camera-concepts/LensOnAperture-1af00b3fa9.gif)

Note: This is a simplification. There are many lenses in a modern camera system many of which are between the aperture and sensor. However, the described concepts are the same between simple and more complex systems.
注意:这是一个简化。现代摄像头系统中有许多镜头,其中许多是在光圈和传感器之间。然而,所描述的概念在简单和更复杂的系统之间是相同的。

Lenses however can only focus light from a fixed distance in front of it, to a fixed distance behind it. Light coming from a different distance in front of it, will focus at a different distance behind it. When a lens is used to bring a feature into focus, features at different distances to the camera will be out of focus.
然而, 镜头只能将光线从它前面的固定距离聚焦到它后面的固定距离。 光线从它前面的不同距离发出, 将聚焦在它背后不同的距离。 当一个镜头被用来聚焦某个特征时, 不同距离的特征将会失焦。
![](https://devcn.djicdn.com/images/camera-concepts/LensDemonstrator-8e641b783a.gif)

Features that are in focus have more light incident on the lens and then redirected to the pixel. Features that are out of focus have light spread over more pixels. Therefore a larger aperture increases the exposure of the picture.
聚焦的特性在镜头上有更多的光入射,然后重定向到像素。失焦的特性使得光线在更多像素上散布。因此,较大的光圈会增加照片的曝光度。

The difference in focus between features at different distances from the camera is known as Depth of Field. Features in a picture captured with a shallow depth of field become strongly out of focus (more blurred) as they change in distance from the camera. Conversely, a picture captured with a deep depth of field will have the same features more in focus.
距摄像头不同距离的特征之间的焦距差被称为景深。用浅景深拍摄的照片中的特征随着距摄像头距离的变化而强烈失焦（更模糊）。相反，以深景深拍摄的照片将具有更多焦点的相同特征。

The two images below show differences in depth of field caused by changing aperture. An M600 is flying in front of a tree. The large f/1.4 aperture creates a depth of field so shallow, that not only is the background strongly out of focus compared to the M600, but some features of the M600 that are closer to or further from the focus plane (front battery) are also slightly out of focus.
下面的两张图片显示了光圈变化引起的景深差异。 一架 M600正在一棵树前飞行。 巨大的 f / 1.4光圈创造了一个如此浅的景深, 不仅背景与 M600相比非常模糊, 而且 M600的某些特性更接近或者更远离焦平面(前置电池) , 也有些偏离焦点。

The smaller f/16 aperture image background is significantly more in focus.
较小的 f / 16光圈图像背景明显地集中在焦点上。

![](images/pic.PNG)

Depth of field can be used to highlight the subject of an image. It is easier to distinguish the M600 from the background when the background is out of focus. On the other hand, if the camera is being used to computationally map a scene with many features at different distances, it would be more appropriate to have the entire image in focus (smaller aperture, deeper depth of field).
景深可以用来突出图像的主题。 当背景失焦时, 更容易将 M600与背景区分开。 另一方面, 如果摄像头被用来拍摄一个在不同距离的许多特征的场景, 那么将整个图像集中在焦点上(光圈较小, 景深更深)。

As an example, DJI's Zenmuse X5 has an aperture adjustable from f/1.7 (large) to f/16 (small). This is a range of 6 1/3 exposure stops.
例如, DJI 的 Zenmuse X5有一个光圈可以从 f / 1.7(大)到 f / 16(小)。 这是一个61 / 3曝光停止的范围。

**Trade-off Between Aperture, Shutter, ISO**
**光圈、快门、 ISO 之间的权衡**

Aperture, shutter speed and ISO need to balanced to achieve a good exposure. However, when each is used to change exposure, depth of field, sharpness, and noise in the picture change.
光圈、快门速度和 ISO 需要平衡以达到良好的曝光。 然而, 当每一个都被用于更改曝光时，图像中的景深，清晰度和噪点都会改变。

The diagram below illustrates the effect of changing aperture, shutter and ISO and how it impacts exposure and the resulting picture.
下图说明了改变光圈、快门和 ISO 的效果, 以及它如何影响曝光度和最终图片。
![](https://devcn.djicdn.com/images/camera-concepts/ExposureTradeoff-d306974b9a.png)

To understand this trade off better, it can be useful to consider several examples.
为了更好地理解这种权衡, 可以考虑几个示例。

Example 1: A well lit, stationary scene. The camera receives lots of light from the scene, and underexposure is not a problem. One way to approach this is:
示例1: 一个灯光明亮, 静止不动的场景。 摄像头从现场接收到大量的光线, 曝光不足不是问题。 解决这个问题的方法是:

Aperture: Either shallow or deep depth of field can be selected. Any change in exposure can be compensated for by the shutter as the scene is stationary. 
光圈: 可以选择浅或深的景深。 曝光的任何变化都可以通过快门来弥补, 因为场景是静止的

ISO: Can be set to minimum setting. Shutter will do all exposure compensation, so can minimize noise. 
ISO 可以设置为最小设置。 快门可以完成所有的曝光补偿, 因此可以减少噪点

Shutter: The scene is stationary, so both fast and slow shutter speeds will result in a sharp picture. Shutter is simply used to get the correct exposure. 
快门: 场景是静止的, 所以快速和缓慢的快门速度都会产生一个清晰的图像。 快门只是用来获得正确的曝光

Example 2: Poorly lit scene with moving features. Sharp picture with in focus features at different distances to the camera desired. This example might require a compromise in the desired depth of field, sharpness or noise in the image. The "poorly lit", "moving features", "sharp picture", "features at different depths in focus" requirements compete with each other. Increasing the exposure to compensate for "poorly lit" will make capturing sharp moving features in focus more difficult. One way to approach this where the noise in the image is the most compromised:
示例2：具有移动功能的光线不足。带有焦点的清晰图像可在距离摄像机所需的不同距离处进行。这个例子可能需要在图像中期望的景深，清晰度或噪声中作出妥协。“光线不足”，“移动特征”，“清晰画面”，“不同焦点深度的特征”要求相互竞争。增加曝光量以补偿“光线不足”会使捕捉清晰移动的焦点更加困难。解决这个问题的一种方式是让图像中的噪点受到最大的损害：

Shutter: Set quick enough to make moving features sharp, but no quicker so the exposure can be maximized. 快门: 设置足够快, 使移动的特征锐利, 但不能更快, 因此曝光可以最大化

Aperture: As large as possible that allows a depth of field that captures the desired features sufficiently in focus. 
光圈: 尽可能大, 使得能够足够集中地拍摄所需特征的深度

ISO: Finally the ISO is increased to get the correct exposure. 
Iso: 最后增加 ISO 以获得正确的曝光

Example 3: Well lit scene of flowing water. A picture that captures the movement of water by letting it blur is desired. This example might be difficult as it will be easy to overexpose the image. One way to approach it is:
示例3: 流水的光线充足的场景。 一幅通过让水变得模糊来拍摄水流运动的图片。 这个示例可能很困难, 因为很容易暴露图像。 一种方法是:

ISO: Set as low as possible to reduce noise and exposure. 
Iso: 尽量降低噪点和曝光率

Aperture: Set as small as possible to reduce exposure. As a consequence all stationary features in the scene will be in focus. 
光圈: 设置尽可能小, 以减少曝光。 因此, 场景中的所有静止特征都将成为焦点

Shutter: Normally, a slow shutter would be desired to blur the movement, but as aperture and ISO have already been set to minimize exposure, there will only be one shutter speed that gives correct exposure. If the scene is very well lit, the blurring of water might not be significant. 
快门: 通常情况下, 缓慢的快门可以模糊动作, 但是由于光圈和 ISO 已经被设置为最小化曝光, 只有一个快门速度可以给出正确的曝光。 如果场景是非常明亮的, 模糊的水可能不是很重要

Note: To control over exposure and use a slower shutter speed, a neutral density (ND) filter that reduces exposure by several stops could be used on the camera lens.
注意: 为了控制曝光速度, 使用较慢的快门速度, 可以在摄像头镜头上使用一个中性密度滤波器来减少曝光。

Example 4: Picture taken with correct exposure, but shutter too slow. Scene motion is blurred in the picture as the shutter speed is too slow. One way to take the next picture is:
示例4: 用正确曝光方式拍摄的照片, 但快门太慢。 由于快门速度太慢, 画面中的场景运动模糊不清。 拍摄下一张照片的一个方法是:

Shutter: Halve the shutter speed, effectively decreasing the exposure by one stop. 
快门: 将快门速度减少一半, 有效地减少一站的曝光

Aperture: Increase the aperture by 1 stop, to compensate for exposure. This assumes depth of field is not a concern. 
光圈: 增加光圈1站, 以补偿曝光。 这个假设的深度是不是一个关注

ISO: No change. 
没有变化

As a final example, consider three pictures with similar exposure taken with different combinations of aperture, ISO and shutter speed.
最后一个示例是, 考虑三张相似曝光的照片, 用光圈、 ISO 和快门速度的不同组合拍摄。

![](images/对比.PNG)

Calculating the difference in exposure for aperture, shutter and ISO for the second and third image relative to the first shows that all images should be approximately the same exposure (with the third being the brightest).

计算光圈、快门和 ISO 相对于第一张照片的曝光差异表明, 所有图像应该大致相同(第三张是最亮的)。

**Field of View and Focal Length**
**视野和焦距**

The field of view defines the extent of a scene a camera can capture and is measured in degrees. A larger field of view sees a larger portion of the scene, while a smaller field of view sees a smaller (but more detailed) portion of the scene. A telephoto lens with high zoom factor is a lens with a narrow field of view.
视野定义了一个镜头可以拍摄到的场景的范围, 并以程度来衡量。 更大的视野可以看到场景的大部分, 而较小的视野会看到场景中较小的部分(但更详细)。 高变焦系数的长焦镜头是一个视野狭窄的透镜。
![](https://devcn.djicdn.com/images/camera-concepts/FieldOfView-2fa31a1034.png)

The distance between a lens and its focal plane (the sensor is at the focal plane) is called the focal length. The focal length is directly related to field of view. As the focal length increases, the field of view decreases (and zoom factor increases).
镜头与焦平面(传感器在焦平面上)之间的距离称为焦距。 焦距与视野直接相关。 随着焦距的增加, 视野减小(并且放大因子增加)。

In the below diagram, a lens is moved away from the sensor, increasing the focal length. When the focal length is small, the two highlighted features are captured near the middle of the sensor. As the focal length increases, the field of view narrows and the same features spread further apart on the sensor, effectively zooming into a smaller part of the scene.
在下图中, 镜头从传感器移开, 增加焦距。 当焦距很小时, 两个突出的特征被捕获在传感器的中间。 随着焦距的增加, 视野变窄, 同样的特征在传感器上扩展得更远, 实际上缩小了场景的一小部分。

Focal length is related to field of view based on sensor size. The diagram above also shows a smaller sensor will have a narrower field of view. Focal lengths are commonly referenced to a full frame sensor (35mm sensor).
焦距与基于传感器大小的视野相关。 上面的图表也显示了一个较小的传感器将有一个更窄的视野。 焦距通常被引用到一个全帧传感器(35毫米传感器)。
![](https://devcn.djicdn.com/images/camera-concepts/FocalLength-e11a23f8bf.gif)

As an example, DJI's Zenmuse X3 camera has a diagonal field of view of 94°, which is equivalent to a 20mm focal length when using a 35mm sensor. Note, the X3 sensor is smaller than 35mm, and so the physical focal length is also smaller.
例如, DJI 的 Zenmuse X3摄像头的视野为94, 相当于使用35毫米传感器时的焦距为20毫米。 注意, X3传感器小于35毫米, 因此物理焦距也较小。

A diagonal field of view can be deconstructed to its horizontal and vertical components by using the aspect ratio of the sensor. X3 has a 4000x3000 pixel sensor, and so the horizontal and vertical field of views are 84° and 62° respectively.
通过使用传感器的纵横比, 可以将视野的对角线解构为其水平和垂直部分。 X3具有4000x3000像素传感器, 所以水平视场和垂直视场分别为84和62。
